        Summary
        <hr/>
    </h2>
   
    <p>
        I am a graduate of Informatics Engineering with internship experience at the Head Office of PT New Ratna Motor, where I was involved in supporting the management and maintenance of IT systems. 
        During the internship, I learned system troubleshooting, ensured smooth operations, and collaborated with the team to resolve technical issues.
        I have strong analytical skills, can quickly adapt to technological changes, and am accustomed to working independently as well as in a team. With this background, 
        I am currently seeking an opportunity to apply my knowledge and contribute to supporting the continuity of information technology systems at your company.
